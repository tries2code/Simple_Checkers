# Simple_Checkers
A simple Checkers game for coding practice

This is a first, and probabaly last, attempt on a checkers game, using fltk and an eviorment by Bjarne Stroustrup, 
introduced in his book "Programming Principles and Practice using C++".


It has the same improvement potential as the chess game from this profile.
