The red color pieces moves first. Each player takes their turn by moving a piece. 

Pieces are always moved diagonally and can be moved in the following ways:
-Diagonally in the forward direction (towards the opponent) to the next dark square.
-If there is one of the opponent's pieces next to a piece and an empty space on the other side, you jump your opponent and their piece will be removed. 
-You can do multiple jumps if they are lined up in the forward direction. 

*** note: if you have a jump, you have no choice but to take it.


King Pieces:

The last row is called the king row. If you get a piece across the board to the opponent's king row, that piece becomes a king. 
It get's a dashed outline. King pieces can move in both directions, forward and backward. 
Once a piece is kinged, the player must wait until the next turn to jump out of the king row, 
unless it is sitting next to a hostile and attackable piece... 


Winning the Game:
You win the game when the opponent has no more pieces. If neither player can move...well you might as well just restart the gamg in that case.#
